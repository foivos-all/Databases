# Databases
<p align="justify">
    This repository holds the implementation of a Database System, which was completed during my third year of studies in the Computer Engineering and Informatics Department at the University of Patras. The aim of the project was to get acquainted with the design, implementation and input of data in a relational Database, which was connected with interfaces (GUIs, Graphical User Interfaces) that were implemented in Java using JDBC technology. The Database concerns an electronic support system for the operations of a Daily Press Publishing House. This system connects journalists who write articles, editors-in-chief, administrative employees and the publisher of each newspaper.
